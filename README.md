# GA-cancelled-voters
R code for statistical analysis of death cancellations off Georgia voter rolls. 
All analyses performed on death_cancellations file, which is a filtered data set from original official data set of all voter cancellations in Georgia from 2012-2018. This original data set has been excluded due to the sensitive nature of such data including names, addresses, and other private information of voters, but it is accessible with special request to the Georgia Secretary of State's Office.
